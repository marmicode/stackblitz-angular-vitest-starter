# Angular Vitest Starter with Browser Mode

This is a starter to reproduce bugs or easily share Angular testing examples using Stackblitz.

Note that we can't spawn a browser in Stackblitz, therefore, the only available option is [`preview` provider](https://vitest.dev/config/browser/preview). This provider is versatile but does not offer all the features of the other providers such as actionability checks.

## Versions

| Package | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Angular | ~21.0.0 |
| Vitest  | ~4.0.0  |

## Shameless plug 😉
